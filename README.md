# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
Pewlett Hackard is preparing for a large amount of baby boomers who are getting ready to retire. I am helping Bobby, the HR analyst, conduct employee research. In our first assignment, we worked together to answer the following questions:
1. Who will be retiring in the next few years?
2. How many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill?
After answering these questions, we gave the company a list of employees elibible for their retirement package. 
Our second task, asked us to answer two further questions. 
1. What is the number of employees retiring per title?
2. Which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program? 
In the following report, I will list four major points from our analysis. I will also offer a summary of the company's current position. 

## Results 
The following two points are from a table in our analysis called "Retiring Titles". This table shows the number of employees who are about to retire grouped by their most recent job title. 

![Retiring_Titles](Resources/Retiring_Titles.png)
* The title with the most positions to fill is "Senior Engineer", which will have 25,916 employees eligible for retirement. 
* The title with the least amount of positions to fill is "Manager" with only two employees eligible for retirement. 

When looking at the table "Mentorship Eligibility", I decided to perform a query to see if the titles "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff" would have a higher amount of possible mentors, as those are the two titles with the most retirees.

* The title with the most eligible mentors is "Senior Staff". That being said, 569 mentors will not be able to support the 24,926 Senior Staff employees retiring. 
*There are 155 eligible "Staff" mentors, which is too many for the 2 employees retiring under that title.

## Summary 
Below is a quick summary of our analysis:
